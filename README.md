# To Run the Development Backend Server

In order to be able to provide realistic examples, we will need in our playground a small REST API backend server. We can start the sample application backend with the following command:

    npm run server

This is a small Node REST API server.

# To run the Development UI Server

To run the frontend part of our code, we will use the Angular CLI:

    npm start 

The application is visible at port 4200: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
